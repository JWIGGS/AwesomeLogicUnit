I'm wiritng this because I am pretty sure I will forget how everything works. So heres the explanation of how to use this.

There are 4 modes that the board can go into:
1) A In
2) B In
3) Out
4) Auto

In every mode, you can use the LEFT and RIGHT BUTTONS to navigate through these different modes.
The first 3 modes are used for manual testing. The Auto mode cycles through test cases and checks to make sure they are correct.


A In and B In
- Use the LEFT and MIDDLE SWITCHES to configure the value of A/B
- use the RIGHT SWITCHES to configure the value of ALUFN
- Press the MIDDLE BUTTON to override the current value of A/B and ALUFN.
- Corresponding LED's should light up according to the saved state. You can navigate between different modes without these values being reset.
- Press and hold the BOTTOM BUTTON in order to view the type of logic on the 7 segment display that is being provided to the ALUFN based on saved state of the ALUFN.

Out
- The LEFT and MIDDLE LED's will show the resulting output.
- use the RIGHT SWITCHES to configure the value of ALUFN
- Press the MIDDLE BUTTON to override the current value of ALUFN.
- Press and hold the BOTTOM BUTTON in order to view the type of logic on the 7 segment display that is being provided to the ALUFN based on saved state of the ALUFN.
- Press and hold the TOP BUTTON to view the Z, V, and N values of the result. The corresponding letter will be shown if that property is true.



Auto
- The type of logic being checked will automatically be shown in the 7 segment display
- The MIDDLE BUTTON will toggle the pause feature and stop cycling through the test cases.
- Press and hold the TOP BUTTON to view the ZVN check. If the ZVN is shown, then the result from the ALU passes the test case. In some cases, ZVN are not tested, in which the display will show --- instead.
- The LEFT and MIDDLE LED's will all be lit up on a successful pass of the test case, or will all be off in the event of a failed test case.
- The RIGHT LED's show the current test case being checked in binary, with the LSB on the far right side.
